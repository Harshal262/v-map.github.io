ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS

Asia is home to a multitude of martial art forms that have captured the attention of the globe. Did you know that India is attributed to be the birthplace of martial arts in Asia? From Kalaripayattu warriors in Kerala to the Samurais of Japan, from acrobatic Ninjas of Japan to the Kung Fu fighters of China that have found a place in movies, games and sports, there is no dearT of martial art forms in Asia. 

"Martial arts is more than just self-protection, it's also about self-perfection." 

Just like the Dragon warrior's quest for inner peace, we invite all artists and photographers to capture moments of martial art brilliance in their art and photos.

Literary submissions have no theme restrictions. Poems, articles, stories, memes, essays can be on any topic.

The theme of Asian Martial Arts is only for art and photos
